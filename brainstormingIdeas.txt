OUT OF CONTROL

Meta-layer out of control:
	Something player usually has control over
		Player abilities are somehow out of control
	Something developer usually has control over
		Procedural generation, level design out of control.
		art
		code
		mechanics
		systems
		values
	Game loses control of some system
	
	Who you start as is out of your control, but who you become is up to you.
		Who you start as: Resources, abilities, mechanics, allies,
		Pick up more/change them as you go.
	Platformer? Strategy? Puzzle? Slow or fast pace?  

Literal layer out of control:
	Rampaging creature of some variety.
	Something spreading out of control, e.g. 
		a virus
		Plant life, something calmer
		Fire, pretty much of any variety
		flooding
	Player losing control of something literal
		A hose for example
		their pet dog
		Your people, you're a king or commander of some kind
		Umbrella
		bullfight
	Apocalypse or disaster
	Rebellion
	Rumors spreading out of control
	(Roguelike, laying wires to power/control tower defense system)
	Superhero out of control of his powers.


	Letting go of control
		A god creates life, tries to direct in right direction.

	SUPER LITERAL: Escape a prison named Control.
		       Running out of a resource called Control.
			"Out", of Control

	React to Aliens: What they do is out of your control, how you act isn't.

	Disaster management
	Assemble a team, but what they do is up to you. TFT, Battlegrounds, etc.
		Deploy agents, give basic instructions, but their actual "field" action is not in your control.
		Auto battler.

	MAIN IDEA I THINK
	Singleplayer autobattler, see enemy layouts before each battle, level consists of multiple battles,
	give simple instructions to units e.g. attack strongest, attack various, attack weakest,  etc.
		Control as a resource to give instructions with, and/or possibly equipment.
	No Movement: Static layout, like Battlegrounds. Keeps scope in check, and still allows for depth.

	Name/Art Theme? Little Wars
