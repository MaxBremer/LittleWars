Little Wars Basic design

Use a resource (temp name CONTROL) to place units, equip them, and give them commands.
Diff units have diff traits, attack patterns, costs etc.
COMMANDS are unique mechanic: Can tell a unit specifically how to attack/act, at cost of resource.
Note: balancing will be difficult.

A level plays out as follows: 
1. Player learns enemy unit layout, number of available slots, maybe some other things.
TBD: DOES PLAYER LEARN ENEMY LAYOUT? MAY WANT TO ADD MYSTERY, RANDOMIZED LAYOUT EACH TIME, SO PLAYER HAS TO MAKE ADAPTABLE TEAM.
PLAYER LEARNS SOME INFO BUT NOT ALL???? PROBS BEST APPROACH.
2. First round is biggest, player decides which units to place. (UNITS ONLY PLACEABLE FIRST ROUND?)
TBD: ROUNDS END AFTER EACH UNIT ACTS? AFTER A UNIT DIES? SOME OTHER CONDITION?
3. After each round, CONTROL can be spent to add commands, change commands, change equipment, maybe heal units.
4. Level ends when one side has no units left. If opponents side, player moves on to next level.


TBD: UNITS ARE SHAPES?? OBJECTS?? Basic meshes at first, improve later.

Game State enum:
	FirstRoundPrep
	Fighting
